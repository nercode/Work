{"role": "assistant", "content": "In December 2023,federal agents uncovered a fraudulent document operation based in Queens,New York,resulting in the seizure of dozens of counterfeit passports.According to the Department of Homeland Security,the operation was led by 42-year-old Rafael Dominguez,who had been producing high-quality fake passports for clients seeking to bypass immigration checks.Authorities report that Dominguez used a combination of stolen blank passport booklets,forged biometric data,and commercial-grade printers.The process began with collecting client photographs and false identity details,followed by digitally embedding the data into customized templates matching the format of genuine passports from multiple countries.The operation remained undetected for nearly a year until a routine customs inspection flagged inconsistencies in a passport used by a traveler arriving at JFK Airport.The investigation eventually led to Dominguez’s arrest.He now faces multiple federal charges including document fraud and identity theft."}
